# Capybara
This Program is a terminal utilitary that makes a capybara say something that you wrote

## Running
after installing it with scoop, or compiling it from the source simply run capybara (argument)
```bash
capybara argument
```
```
    /\__/\_
   /       \
  /    0    \----------_
 | Y                    \  argument
 \______/                \
       \                 |
        |   /-______-|    \
        |   |         \   /
       //__/         //__/

```
if no arguments are provided it will simply say "Capybara supremacy!"
```
    /\__/\_
   /       \
  /    0    \----------_
 | Y                    \  Capybara supremacy!
 \______/                \
       \                 |
        |   /-______-|    \
        |   |         \   /
       //__/         //__/

```

## Something There
Just a test to add buckets and packages to the scoop. Nothing interesting to see here.

```bash
scoop bucket add capybara https://github.com/RyanM-Ferreira/capybara-cli bucket
scoop install capybara
```
